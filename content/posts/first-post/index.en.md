I had kept this site that be not good when migrated to [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).  

Yesterday, I found [coder](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) when serfed themes.  

I decided immidiately because the theme is simple. Fit my motto.  


Tuning some configures and  re-start blog.
